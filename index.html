        <p>I read books in my free time. I feel very happy and delighted after reading books. I understand the morals that are in the stories and I mostly try them on every day to live my life good. I also try to understand the qoutes written in the books. I really feel that some super knowledge is going inside my brain. After reading books, I improve my reading skills. I mostly read books in the evening while having snacks. I started reading books daily when my first term exam started when I was 8 years old and I was in 3 standard. In one month I became more punctual, displined in my life. If you don't like to read, I bet that if you read daily for at least one week you will realise that you have changed yourself. This hobby can develop in anybody!</p>
